#### Name Leo Garcia
#### Project Name: Eight to Ten
#### Date: 1/11/2023
#### Description: An API that has three final controllers for three more functions, linked to different files. Not sure what else to say. Also didn't realize the first version was also based on previous works for some reason.
#### Peer Reviewer: Mark Ortega
#### Review Notes: There should be a space between the games number and the losing sentence for the guess it but other than that everything works well, job well done.
#### Dev Notes: Fixed readability according to review
